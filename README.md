## Database Schema

### Users Table
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `email` (Unique identifier)
- `password` (Plain text - for demo purposes)
- `fullname`
- `address`
- `phone`
- `pincode`

### Parking Lots Table
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `name`
- `location`
- `total_spots`
- `available_spots`
- `price_per_hour`

### Parking Spots Table
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `spot_number` (e.g., A01, A02)
- `is_occupied` (Boolean)
- `parking_lot_id` (Foreign Key)

### Bookings Table
- `id` (Primary Key)
- `vehicle_number`
- `booking_time`
- `release_time`
- `status` (active/completed/cancelled)
- `total_cost`
- `user_id` (Foreign Key)
- `parking_spot_id` (Foreign Key)
- `parking_lot_id` (Foreign Key)

## How It Works

### Spot Management
- When you create a parking lot, spots are automatically generated (A01, A02, etc.)
- Removing lots only works if they're not currently occupied in any spot
- Each spot tracks its occupied status

### Booking Process
- Users select a parking lot from the list
- System shows available spots for that lot
- User picks a spot and enters vehicle number
- Spot becomes occupied and unavailable to others
- Cost calculated when user releases the spot

### Pricing
- Each parking lot has its own hourly rate
- Minimum charge is 1 hour
- Final cost = hourly rate Ã— hours parked (rounded up)

### Admin Functions
- First registered user becomes admin automatically
- Admins can manage all parking lots and spots
- Can view all user information and booking history
- Can manually release any occupied spot

### Basic Statistics
- User dashboard shows total bookings and spending
- Admin reports show system-wide stats
- Simple counting and summation of database records
